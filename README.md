# Isomorphism in biological networks
Graph Isomorphism Is Widely Used In Various Applications Such As Image Processing, Protein Structure, Computer And Information System, Chemical Bond Structure, Social Networks.
We Use Protein Structure ,Nodes Represents Protein And Edges Represents Their Interactions Between Nodes.
We Have Three Levels Of Protein Structure I.E. , Primary Structure ,Secondary Structure , Tertiary Structure.
For Example Collection Of Food Is Available And Every Food Is Having Their Own Structure That Is Graph Structure. For Providing The Food And That Food Contains Some Proteins, Then Find Protein Graph Structure First And Check Where It Is Available In The Food Structure Or Not.
